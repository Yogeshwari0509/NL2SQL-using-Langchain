# NL2SQL-using-Langchain

Introduction to the Project
Welcome to Natural Language to SQL conversion project! This project aims to simplify the process of querying databases by allowing users to input queries in natural language format and converting them into SQL queries.

Description of the Natural Language to SQL Conversion Functionality
The Natural Language to SQL conversion tool leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interpret user queries. It parses the input text, identifies key entities, and maps them to corresponding SQL syntax. This enables users to interact with databases using everyday language, eliminating the need to learn complex SQL syntax.
